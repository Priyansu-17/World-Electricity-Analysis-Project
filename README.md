This project focuses on the analysis of global electricity production, transmission, distribution losses, and access data. By aggregating data from various sources, cleaning and preprocessing it, and performing detailed analysis, we aim to provide insights into electricity trends and disparities across regions and income groups. The results are visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard, and findings are summarized in a comprehensive report.
